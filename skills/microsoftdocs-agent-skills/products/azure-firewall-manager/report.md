| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [DNS settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/dns-settings) | configuration | 0.75 | Describes DNS settings including default behavior (Azure DNS, DNS Proxy disabled) and how to configure custom DNS and proxy; these are explicit configuration parameters and defaults. |
| [Architecture options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/vhubs-and-vnets) | decision-making | 0.70 | Compares two Azure Firewall Manager architecture options with service-specific considerations; while summary is high-level, the full article is a decision guide for when to use each architecture, which is product-specific decision-making content. |
| [Define a rule hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/rule-hierarchy) | configuration | 0.70 | Explains how to structure rule hierarchy in Firewall policy to enforce compliance while enabling CI/CD; this is product-specific configuration of rule ordering and scope. |
| [FQDN in network rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/fqdn-filtering-network-rules) | configuration | 0.70 | Describes using FQDNs in network rules based on DNS resolution and the requirement to enable DNS Proxy; these are concrete, product-specific configuration requirements. |
| [Threat intelligence settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/threat-intelligence-settings) | security | 0.70 | Covers how to enable and process threat intelligence-based filtering in Firewall policy, including ordering relative to NAT/network/app rules; these are product-specific security configuration behaviors. |
| [Configure DDoS Protection Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/configure-ddos) | security | 0.65 | Describes associating virtual networks with DDoS Protection plans, and a product-specific workaround for unsupported Virtual WANs via force tunneling; these are concrete security configuration behaviors. |
| [IP Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/ip-groups) | configuration | 0.65 | Describes IP Groups as reusable objects in DNAT, network, and application rules, including constraints like uniqueness of group names and how they’re used across regions/subscriptions; this is product-specific configuration behavior not captured by generic knowledge. |
| [Migrate to Firewall policy - PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/migrate-to-policy) | configuration | 0.65 | Details a migration script that creates FirewallPolicy and RuleCollectionGroup objects with specific structure; these are product-specific configuration objects and migration behavior. |
| [Manage WAF policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/manage-web-application-firewall-policies) | security | 0.60 | Shows how to centrally create and associate WAF policies for Front Door and Application Gateway; this is product-specific security policy management behavior. |
| [Rule processing logic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/rule-processing) | best-practices | 0.60 | Explains Azure Firewall’s specific rule processing order across NAT, network, and application rules; this product-specific evaluation logic is important for correct rule design and is not generic firewall behavior. |
| [Secure private endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/private-link-inspection-secure-virtual-hub) | configuration | 0.60 | Explains how to use network and application rules in a secured virtual hub to inspect traffic to Private Endpoints; this is a product-specific configuration pattern for Private Link scenarios. |
